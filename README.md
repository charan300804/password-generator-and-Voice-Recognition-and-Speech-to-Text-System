# Voice Recognition and Password Generation Program

This project demonstrates a Python program that performs voice recognition and speech-to-text conversion, along with generating a random password. The program uses the `speech_recognition` library to capture audio from the microphone, processes it using Google's Web Speech API, and prints the recognized text. It also generates a random password based on user-specified length.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Capture and recognize speech from the microphone.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Convert recognized speech to text and save it to a file.
- **Password Generation**: Generate a random password with a specified length.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
## Install the Required Libraries: Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio
Usage
## Run the Program: Execute the script to start the program.

python app.py
Generate a Random Password:

The program will prompt you to enter the length of the password.

It will then generate a random password consisting of letters, digits, and punctuation.

Voice Recognition:

The program will adjust for ambient noise and prompt you to speak.

It will capture and recognize your speech, converting it to text.

The recognized text will be displayed and saved to transcriptions.txt.

## Exit the Program:

After each speech recognition cycle, the program will prompt you to press Enter to continue or type 'quit' to exit.

## Example Output
Modules are installed successfully!
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
Enter the length of the password: 12
Your password is: a1!b2@c3#d4$e5
Adjusting for ambient noise... Please wait.
Listening... Please speak now.
Recognizing speech...
You said: Hello, how are you?
